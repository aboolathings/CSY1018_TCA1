                Short blog post today - I started out my blog with some very simple things, baby steps
                and all... picking the colour palette and layout, setting up my pages etc made me feel
                accomplished even though in hindsight I didn't really do anything... now for the hard
                part! Actually coding this thing... wish me luck!

                Today I learned how to animate, it was frustrating at first but once I got the knack
                of it I couldn't stop! Adding in colour changes and transitions on hover, on everything
                that I could think of! I'm glad I overcame this hurdle as I want to make sure my website
                has the best chance of receiving a decent grade. Web design has been my second favourite
                module so far and I really hope that everything turns out okay.

                Today I learned a lot in my html and css programming journey - I started on mobile 
                optimisation and found it incredibly challenging, in changing one thing I fixed a 
                different issue I was having but not the original problem, it's a slow process and I 
                fear as I submit this tonight the portfolio page may still not be perfect on mobile, 
                but at least it is within the page parameters instead of being off screen. Hopefully
                my video should be an easy process as I have experience with OBS through streaming on
                twitch... I just really hope my code doesn't need too much editing when I validate it
                later.
