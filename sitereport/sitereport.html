            This assignment was my first experience with using html and css (outside of adding fancy things to my tumblr blog years ago!)
            and it was a lot of fun. I'm a very visual learner and creative individual, so being able to see my progress live with every
            line of code was both satisfying and rewarding. I much preferred this to learning Java for the first time, and no doubt I will
            most likely prefer this to javascript too! Now with no further ado... let's crack on with the report!
        </p>
        <p>
            Firstly, I would like to detail my design choices and the websites I used to help with this process!
            I started off my picking the colour palette which I did through the help of <a href= "https://coolors.co/"> coolors</a>. I chose 
            this palette &#8592 as purple, green and pink are my favourite colours. I used rose red for the navigation bar, medium purple for 
            the titles of the nav bar, maximum blue purple as my main background, magic mint as my aside background and apricot for the hover 
            animations. Luckily the website converts colours into rgba for you so I didn't need to use an additional website for conversion 
            purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            For my background I used <a href= "https://unsplash.com/"> unsplash</a> to find a royalty free image for my background. Sticking to the
            colour theme I have, I went with wisteria for aesthetic purposes, this particular background was by user Aki Nakazawa &#8592
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, I chose my font using <a href= "https://fonts.google.com/"> google fonts</a> . I wanted something both fluid and whimsical to fit with
            the theme of my website, other fonts seemed too heavy or too block like, or alternatively were too illegible from looking too much
            like handwriting so I chose the Shadows Into Light font as seen below, I used my favourite Shakespearean soliloquy to test out the
            text so I could visualise what it would look like in a full sentence/ paragraph. As seen to the left &#8592

        <p> Welcome to my site report!! This will be a report detailing my experience of learning to develop in html and css.
            I will be including links to websites that helped me with the process of creating this website, choosing the colour
            palette, fonts and background. I will be documenting my progress here over time, as well as screenshots proving the 
            code is valid.
