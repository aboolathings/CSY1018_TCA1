            Hello there! My name is hannah. I also go by aboola online! My preferred nickname is han.

            I'm a university student by day and a supermarket assistant by night. I'm currently studying software engineering at the university of northampton in the uk.
            Before deciding to come to university I was working at a dental practice, I am a qualified dental nurse since 2018 and was in dentistry studying as an apprentice since 2016.
            It may seem like a big jump going from dentistry to computing- covid healthcare was incredibly difficult with the added restrictions and not only did it take a toll
            on my health both mentally and physically, I started to fall out of love with the job; so I decided to follow a career that has always been a passion of mine.
        </p>
        <p>   
            By no means do I regret my time in dentistry at all, I have made a lot of friends from being in the field and without it I would never have my best friend who I love dearly.

            I built my own pc in early 2021 and have always been an avid gamer, playing consoles since the age of 5 and getting my own at the age of 7.

            Outside of my professional life, a huge passion of mine is cosplay - dressing up as characters from anime, games and popular media to bring characters I love to life.
            I have experience with all areas of cosplay including wig styling, sewing, prop building and photoshoots.
        </p>

            As previously mentioned I have loved video games for most of my life, it's hard to pinpoint a favourite game of all time but as of right now
            my favourite games are genshin impact, animal crossing, triangle strategy and dead by daylight.
