            Hello there! My name is hannah. I also go by aboola online! My preferred nickname is han.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a university student by day and a supermarket assistant by night. I'm currently studying software engineering at the university of 
            northampton in the uk.
            Before deciding to come to university, I was working at a dental practice. I am a qualified dental nurse since 2018 and was in dentistry 
            studying as an apprentice since 2016.
            It may seem like a big jump going from dentistry to computing- covid healthcare was incredibly difficult with the added restrictions and 
            not only did it take a toll on my health both mentally and physically, I started to fall out of love with the job; so I decided to follow 
            a career that has always been a passion of mine.
        </p>
        <p>   
            By no means do I regret my time in dentistry at all, I have made a lot of friends from being in the field and without it I would never have 
            met my best friend who I love dearly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I built my own pc in early 2021 and have always been an avid gamer, playing consoles since the age of 5 and getting my own at the age of 7.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Outside of my professional life, a huge passion of mine is cosplay - becoming characters from anime, games and popular media and bringing 
            them to life... there is nothing I love more. I have experience with all areas of cosplay including wig styling, sewing, prop building and 
            photoshoots.
        </p>
        <p>
            As previously mentioned I have loved video games for most of my life, it's hard to pinpoint a favourite game of all time but as of right now
            my favourite games are genshin impact, animal crossing, triangle strategy and dead by daylight.
